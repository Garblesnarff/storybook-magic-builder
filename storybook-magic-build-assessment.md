## Project Overview

This project appears to be a web application designed for creating children's storybooks. It leverages a modern frontend stack (React, TypeScript, Vite) with UI components from Shadcn UI and styling via Tailwind CSS. The backend seems to be powered by Supabase, handling authentication, database storage, file storage (for images/audio), and serverless functions for AI integration (text, image, and narration generation).

### Core Purpose

The application aims to simplify the process of creating illustrated children's books by providing a visual editor interface with various page layouts, coupled with AI-powered tools for generating text content, illustrations, and potentially audio narration. It likely targets users who want to create personalized storybooks without needing advanced writing or illustration skills. The inclusion of PDF export suggests the goal is to produce shareable or printable book formats.

### Target Audience

-   Parents wanting to create personalized stories for their children.
-   Educators creating custom learning materials.
-   Aspiring children's book authors prototyping ideas.
-   Hobbyists interested in creative writing and AI tools.

## Current State Assessment

### Implemented Features

Based on the file structure and dependencies, the following features appear to be implemented to some degree:

1.  **User Authentication:** Supabase Auth integration (`AuthContext`, `AuthPage`, `ProtectedRoute`).
2.  **Book Management:** Listing, creation (potentially from templates), title editing, deletion (`BooksPage`, `BookCard`, `BookList`, `EditableTitle`, `useBookManager`, `bookService`).
3.  **Page Editor Interface:** A dedicated editor view (`EditorPage`, `PageEditor`) with support for different page layouts (`components/editor/layouts/`).
4.  **Page Management:** Adding, deleting, duplicating, and reordering pages within the editor (`PageList`, `PagePreview`, `react-beautiful-dnd`, `usePageOperations`).
5.  **Text Editing & Formatting:** Basic text input and formatting options (`TextSettings`, `BookTextRenderer`, `useTextEditor`).
6.  **AI Text Generation:** Integration for generating story text (`useAITextGeneration`, `generate-text` Supabase function).
7.  **AI Image Generation:** Integration for generating images based on text/prompts, including style selection (`useAIImageGeneration`, `generate-image` Supabase function, `ImagePlaceholder`, `IMAGE_STYLES`).
8.  **AI Narration Generation:** Integration for generating audio narration (`useNarration`, `generate-narration` Supabase function, `audioStorage`).
9.  **Image Handling:** Image display with zoom/pan capabilities (`image-zoom/` components and hooks).
10. **PDF Export:** Functionality to export the created book as a PDF (`pdfExport.ts`).
11. **Settings:** A dedicated settings page (`SettingsPage`), likely for user preferences (e.g., default author, styles).
12. **Routing:** Multi-page navigation using `react-router-dom`.
13. **UI Foundation:** Utilizes Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
14. **State Management:** Primarily uses React Context (`AuthContext`, `BookContext`) and custom hooks (`useBookManager`, `usePageState`, `useAIOperations`).

### Technical Foundation

-   **Framework/Library:** React 18, TypeScript
-   **Build Tool:** Vite 5
-   **UI:** Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion (for animations)
-   **Routing:** React Router v6
-   **State Management:** React Context, Custom Hooks, React Query (likely for Supabase data fetching/caching)
-   **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL DB via `postgrest-js`, Storage, Edge Functions)
-   **AI Integrations (Inferred from Functions):** Groq (for text), Gemini (for images), ElevenLabs (for narration)
-   **Other Key Libraries:** `react-beautiful-dnd` (page reordering), `jspdf` (PDF export), `uuid`, `date-fns`, `zod` (validation likely used with forms/API).

### Development Stage

The project appears to be in an **active development stage, likely nearing or partially achieving MVP functionality**. Key components like authentication, CRUD for books/pages, the editor interface, core AI features (text, image, narration), and export functionality seem structurally present. However, the presence of significant technical debt (see below) and potential gaps suggest it requires further refinement, testing, and polish before being considered a stable MVP.

## Path to MVP

### Critical Missing Features

*(Code review needed for confirmation)*

1.  **Cover Image Functionality:** No clear mechanism for setting/generating a book cover image, although `BookCard` expects one.
2.  **Robust State Synchronization:** Ensure editor changes (text, layout, image settings) reliably persist and reflect across components (e.g., page previews) without race conditions or data loss. The presence of `useRealTimeText` is noted, but broader state consistency needs verification.
3.  **Comprehensive Error Handling:** [RESOLVED 2025-04-28] PDF export logic (`src/services/pdfExport.ts`) now features robust error handling. Each page export is wrapped in a try/catch, errors are logged and surfaced to the user via toast notifications. If any pages fail to export, the user is notified with a destructive toast listing the failed pages. If the entire export fails, a descriptive error toast is shown. This ensures users are always informed of export issues and improves reliability and user experience.
4.  **Usability & UX Polish:** Refine editor interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop smoothness, loading indicators, tooltips, consistent feedback).
5.  **Template Finalization:** Ensure `createBookFromTemplate` correctly populates the entire book structure based on the selected template.
6.  **Narration Playback Integration:** While generation exists, integration of playback controls directly within the editor (across different layouts) might be incomplete.
7.  **Settings Application:** Verify that settings configured on the `SettingsPage` (e.g., default author, image style) are correctly applied during book/content creation.

### Technical Debt to Address

1.  **Inconsistent Package Management:** Presence of both `bun.lockb` and `package-lock.json`. Need to standardize on one (likely `bun`).
2.  **UI Component Structure:** Duplication/inconsistency in `src/components/ui`. Many components exist directly and also within subdirectories (e.g., `button/`, `input/`). Needs consolidation and consistent use of aliases defined in `components.json`.
3.  **TypeScript Strictness:** [RESOLVED 2025-04-27] `tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.app.json` now enable `strict` mode and `noImplicitAny`. Type safety and maintainability are greatly improved. All code passes strict type checks.
4.  **Hook Complexity/Prop Drilling:** Hooks like `usePageState` might be overly complex. Potential for prop drilling in the editor component hierarchy (`EditorPage` -> `EditorMainContent` -> `EditorContent` -> children). Consider refactoring or using a more robust state manager if needed.
5.  **Lack of Testing:** No dedicated testing directories or configuration observed. Unit, integration, and E2E tests are crucial, especially given the complexity.
6.  **Dependency Health:** Need to audit dependencies for outdated versions or known vulnerabilities (`npm audit` or `bun audit`). The ESLint/TypeScript-ESLint version mismatch (`eslint` v9 vs `@typescript-eslint` v8) could cause linting issues.
7.  **Documentation Gaps:** While some READMEs exist (good!), internal code comments and comprehensive documentation for complex hooks/services might be missing.
8.  **Error Handling Consistency:** Ensure errors from Supabase calls, AI functions, and internal logic are handled consistently across services and hooks.

### Effort Estimation

*(Estimates are high-level and depend heavily on actual code quality)*

-   **Technical Debt Cleanup (Package Manager, UI Components, TS Strictness):** 8-15 days
-   **Hook Refactoring & State Management Improvements:** 4-7 days
-   **Implement Missing MVP Features (Cover Image, State Sync, UX Polish):** 7-10 days
-   **Basic Test Coverage (Unit/Integration):** 10-15 days
-   **Total MVP Refinement & Debt Reduction:** Approximately **30-47 developer days**.

## Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Standardize Package Manager:** Choose either `bun` or `npm`. Remove the unused lockfile (`package-lock.json` if using Bun, or `bun.lockb` if using npm), delete `node_modules`, and reinstall dependencies using the chosen manager.
2.  **Consolidate UI Components:** Refactor `src/components/ui` to remove duplication and ensure consistent usage based on `components.json` aliases.
3.  **Review Core Hooks:** Analyze `usePageState` and `useBookManager` for complexity and potential refactoring opportunities (e.g., breaking down further, using Zustand if needed).
4.  **Implement Cover Image Flow:** Design and implement the feature for users to set or generate a cover image for their book.
5.  **Add Basic Tests:** Start with unit tests for utility functions and services (mocking Supabase calls). Add integration tests for critical editor interactions (e.g., applying AI text/image).

### Testing Requirements

-   **Unit Tests:** For utility functions (`utils/`, `lib/`), service functions (mocking Supabase), complex hooks (`usePageState`, `useBookManager`, AI hooks), and PDF generation logic. Framework: Vitest or Jest.
-   **Integration Tests:** For component interactions within the editor (layout changes, text formatting, image settings persistence), authentication flow, and book/page CRUD operations. Framework: React Testing Library with Vitest/Jest.
-   **E2E Tests:** For critical user flows: Sign Up -> Create Book -> Edit Page (Text & Image) -> Add Page -> Reorder Pages -> Export PDF -> Sign Out. Framework: Playwright or Cypress.

## Deployment Considerations

-   **Hosting:** Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages) suitable for a Vite React app.
-   **Backend:** Supabase project required (Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions).
-   **Environment Variables:** Securely manage API keys:
    -   `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (Client-side)
    -   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (Server-side/Edge Functions - if needed, usually implicit)
    -   `GEMINI_API_KEY` (For Supabase `generate-image` function)
    -   `GROQ_API_KEY` (For Supabase `generate-text` function)
    -   `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (For Supabase `generate-narration` function)
-   **CI/CD:** Implement a pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to lint, test, build, and deploy the application upon code changes.
-   **Supabase Migrations:** Need a process for managing database schema changes if applicable.

## Long-Term Vision

-   More advanced text editing (Rich Text Editor).
-   Additional page layout templates and customization options.
-   Support for different book sizes/formats.
-   Collaboration features for co-authoring.
-   User-uploaded images/assets.
-   More sophisticated AI features (e.g., story outlining, character consistency checks, style transfer for images).
-   Different export options (ePub, print-ready formats).
-   Community features for sharing created books.
-   Improved accessibility (WCAG compliance).

## Known Issues (2025-04-27)

### AI Assistant Pane
- Image generation works and art style selector functions, but images cannot be added to the book page.
- Text generation works, but prompts need further fine-tuning for quality. **(Note: Plan to improve prompt engineering for better story relevance and creativity in a future update.)**

### Layout Section
- The following layout selections do not work:
    - 'text right, image left'
    - 'text bottom, image top'
- There are duplicate selections for 'full page image' and 'full page text'. Of these, only the bottom buttons in each vertical row work; the middle-row duplicates do not.
- Total of 10 layout options, arranged in 2 vertical rows of 5.

### Page Text Editing
- Attempting to edit text on book pages can trigger a display loop or UI glitch.

### Audio Generation
- Audio narration does not work. Error encountered:
    - `audioStorage.ts:33 Error uploading audio: {statusCode: '403', error: 'Unauthorized', message: 'new row violates row-level security policy'}`
- This appears to be a Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) configuration issue for the audio storage table.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1.  **AI API Costs & Rate Limits:** Usage of Gemini, Groq, and ElevenLabs could incur significant costs or hit usage limits as user base grows.
2.  **AI Output Quality/Safety:** AI-generated content might be inconsistent, inappropriate for children, or not match user expectations. Need content moderation/filtering.
3.  **State Management Complexity:** The current hook-based approach might become difficult to manage and debug as features increase.
4.  **PDF Export Performance/Accuracy:** Generating PDFs with complex layouts and high-res images can be resource-intensive and might not perfectly match the editor preview.
5.  **Supabase Limitations:** Hitting limits on Supabase's free/pro tiers (database size, storage bandwidth, function execution time).
6.  **Security:** Exposing API keys (if not handled correctly via Edge Functions), insecure storage rules, lack of input sanitization for AI prompts.

### Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Cost/Limit Management:** Implement usage monitoring, user quotas, or tiered pricing. Explore caching generated content where appropriate. Have fallback AI providers if possible.
2.  **AI Quality/Safety:** Add prompt engineering safeguards, allow users to easily edit/regenerate content, potentially implement content filtering APIs. Clearly state AI limitations.
3.  **State Management:** Monitor hook complexity. Consider adopting a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) if complexity warrants it. Ensure clear separation of concerns.
4.  **PDF Export:** Optimize image handling for PDF generation (compression, resolution limits). Test export thoroughly across different layouts and content types. Consider server-side PDF generation for heavy tasks.
5.  **Supabase Scaling:** Monitor Supabase usage dashboards. Optimize database queries and storage usage. Plan for potential upgrades.
6.  **Security:** Ensure all API keys are stored securely as environment variables within Supabase Edge Functions. Implement robust Supabase Row Level Security (RLS). Sanitize all user inputs, especially prompts sent to AI APIs. Validate image uploads.

## Integration Considerations

-   **Supabase:** Tightly integrated for Auth, Database, Storage, and Edge Functions. Requires careful management of Supabase client and RLS policies.
-   **External AI APIs (Gemini, Groq, ElevenLabs):** Accessed via Supabase Edge Functions. Need to handle API key security, potential errors, and response formats from these services within the functions.

## Success Metrics

MVP status is achieved when a user can reliably perform the following core loop:

1.  Sign up and log in successfully.
2.  Create a new book (either blank or from a basic template).
3.  Add at least 3-5 pages to the book.
4.  For each page:
    *   Add/edit text content.
    *   Select a page layout.
    *   Generate at least one image using AI based on page text.
    *   Generate text content for at least one page using AI.
5.  Reorder pages successfully.
6.  Delete a page successfully.
7.  Export the created book (minimum 3 pages with text and images) to a readable PDF format without critical errors or visual distortions.
8.  The application remains stable without frequent crashes or data loss during these operations.
